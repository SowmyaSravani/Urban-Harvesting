  <h1>About Urban Harvesting</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Urban Harvesting</strong> is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between 
    <b>farmers and urban consumers</b>. Our goal is to empower farmers by eliminating middlemen, 
    ensuring they receive fair prices for their produce, while providing city residents with 
    fresh, locally grown food at affordable rates.
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To build a sustainable, transparent, and equitable food supply chain that connects farmers directly 
    with consumers — making agriculture profitable and urban living healthier.
  </p>

  <h2>🚜 Our Mission</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To empower small-scale farmers through digital tools and fair trade opportunities.</li>
    <li>To promote locally sourced, organic, and seasonal produce for healthier urban communities.</li>
    <li>To reduce foodS wastage, transportation costs, and carbon footprint through smart logistics.</li>
    <li>To create transparency in pricing and ensure traceability of every food item sold.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Farmers use our simple mobile app to list available produce with real-time updates on prices and stock.
    Consumers in urban areas can browse through the listings, compare rates, and place orders directly from
