# Urban-Harvesting
Urban Harvesting is a web application that directly connects farmers with urban consumers, enabling fresh produce sales without middlemen. It offers real-time listings, fair pricing, and easy ordering, helping farmers earn more while consumers access fresh, affordable, farm-to-table produce.
